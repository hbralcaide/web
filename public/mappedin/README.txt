Place your MVF ZIP here and name it market.mvf.zip.
Example expected path when running dev server:
  http://localhost:3001/mappedin/market.mvf.zip

How to obtain MVF:
- If you have access to the Mappedin portal, export the MVF (v2) for your venue.
- Otherwise, contact Mappedin support for a direct MVF link for your venue ID: 68ee9141b47af0000bc138c1.

Once added, restart the Vite dev server so the .env change is picked up.
